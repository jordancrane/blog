      Back when I was in college I owned a 1995 manual-transmission SUV that was a total tank. It served me well during countless trips between Corvallis and Seattle, where my family lives; and on many adventures in between. It guzzled gas, was littered with CDs (the only reliable method to listen to music without advertisements on the outdated head unit), and had stains on the cloth seats from where my parents&rsquo; dog had vomited all over it on the way to the vet after eating a bunch of chicken poop fertilizer; but man did I love that car.

      Although I&rsquo;m currently unemployed thanks to the global pandemic, the transition to remote work in my previous position brought about many changes to the way my team and I worked; some good, some bad. While I enjoyed the ability to work uninterrupted during periods of flow, I missed the spontaneous exchanges that were prone to happen in an office space but failed to materialize in the remote world. This was somewhat mitigated by the fact that my teammates and I were already close, but it still felt hindered.

      I started this site with the original purpose of hosting my resume for easy sharing without much else in mind. That&rsquo;s still mostly all it does, but I&rsquo;ve solved a few problems along the way to make deployments (slightly) cleaner, so I thought I would document my process here.
I keep my resume in version control in a markdown file, and then use the fabulous Pandoc to convert it to a variety of formats, namely an HTML file for hosting and a PDF file for sharing over email.

  <p>
    
      If you&rsquo;re anything like me you are super particular about your terminal setup. I am capable of working in most terminal environments, but since I spend a lot more time using the setup on my personal computer than those on machines I SSH into, I figure it&rsquo;s worth spoiling myself in that context, despite the fact that it might incur a slight efficiency penalty when I&rsquo;m using machines without all the niceties that I like to add.
